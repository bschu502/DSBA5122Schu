## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
  #install.packages(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
df <- read_csv("C:/Users/brian/OneDrive/Documents/DSBA5122/FinalProjectDSBA5122Schu/data/Insurance.csv")
#summary(df)
df1 <- df %>%
  filter(Location_Name == "North Carolina")
summary(df1)
ggplot(df, aes(x = Date, y = "% Uninsured")) +
  geom_point()
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(df1, aes(x = Date, y = "% Uninsured")) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
 
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
